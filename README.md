### Welcome to Bharath Fetch Recipes App

Overview:
Bharath Fetch Recipes App fetches and displays recipes from a remote JSON API. It includes networking, image caching, error handling, and unit tests. 

Summary: 
Included screen shots and a video of the app

Focus Areas:
Prioritized SwiftUI UI, async/await networking, error handling, and image caching to ensure a smooth experience and efficient performance.

Time Spent:
Spent 5-6 hours
* 2 hours on developing UI
* 1.5 hours on networking and caching
* 1 hour on error handling
* 1 hour on unit testing

Trade-offs and Decisions:
* Chose async/await for simplicity.
* Used NSCache for manual image caching.

Weakest Part of the Project:
* No pagination implemented. All recipes load at once.
* Simple UI which lacks animations, sorting, and search functionality.

Additional Information:
* Could enhance with search and sorting.
* Could add pagination.
